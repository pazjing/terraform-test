Risk 
=======================================
1. A more security way to input aws secret key. Use profile setting or variable setting in repository host setting might be better.
2. ssh key management. If a key pair is given by organization, we should use it instead the current way.
3. Need security review for the security group and network ACL rule, expecially the allow cidr_block should set to proper one.
4. For real case, should not use HTTP for NGINXã€‚ HTTPS should be use.
5. As provisioner is not recommended by terraform, it is better to use other way. like, put scripts to s3, or use command on userdata
6. Use the default python on ec2 which is python 2. It is better to use python 3.
7. The AMI I select might not be avaiable on all region. 
8. It is better to build a self own ami.
